                            <p> Is it possible to set a default value for predefined attribute members? I am finding I have to manually edit users profiles to set or its blank. Is it possible to use an incoming attribute string (such as Department) to select a predefined attribute member? Is it possible to create a null attribute member or pass null in reference format? Another issue where if one attribute member is defined, you must set ALL of them. I've a specific use case where a SAML integration requires strings. So on my personal PS4, I have a profile that the primary and has the ps+ on it, and so any other profile that I have also has it, and whatever I buy on that one, etc. I can also do online function stuff normally. EDIT: MY ps4 has nothing to do with my brother, I merely mentioned it to make a point However, on my brother's ps4, he's trying to log on to fornite on a secondary profile from the one that has the ps+, and it tells him he needs to log in to ps network Hello, all! For some of us, we've been playing this game a hella while, and I'm curious about some of your tendencies overtime, or even just some of your goals. If there's anyone you want for the future, or anyone you tried to get and do or don't have How much quartz do you have? How many prisms? Rare prisms? QP? FP? Are you saving for anyone/thing? Also, I am curious about this too, do you try to get every lore? In my case, I can't screencap rn but: Quartz: 9 days ago, I asked if there would be any interest on here for my TSM profile (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/5f1a66/returned_to_legion_spent_a_weekend_learning_how/) that I had used to make 18,000 gold in 24 hours, and that some of my guildmates were also using to make 2-10k+ gold per day on the AH. Seeing as I haven't played for years, I wasn't sure if that was a lot of gold or not. From what I've gathered since coming back, it's sort of okay. Anyway, there seemed. I have completed a build using an R5 1600 and have a stable oc to 3.7 and the memory is holding at 3200. However, when it boots it takes a good 60 seconds to post and will keep switching off and on. Once booted up it is stable. I was wondering if it would be better to set the bios settings back and only overclock via the Ryzen Master app? Does anyone do it this way? Thanks. I think my son has changed my master account to a kids profile and I can't change it back. Any thoughts 
Looking at screenshots and reading the Ryzen Master user guide, I see no mention of the ability to enable/disable SMT either globally or per-CCX. Now, obviously, per-CCX would be a pretty neat trick, but if customization is the route that you're going with RM, it would be fantastic to be able to specify SMT state in the processor profile no matter if it's global or local. This would be a major boon for anyone who wants to tune the 8-core CPUs for more single-threaded workloads, and would So I got a PS4 and thought I'd start a new PSN ID. I set up the new ID as I was setting up the PS4 so this new ID is the Master Profile on the system. However, after discovering some stuff re: accounts that I should have checked beforehand, I now just want to use the old PSN ID that I had used before (which is set up as another user on the system). Can I remove the new ID that was made the Master Profile and replace The Challenger/Master profile banner has not the correct size. (It's been like this since last season) Here's a pic of it: http://i.imgur.com/UzfKakh.png. Hello all, I really think that the new Master profile border should be given to plat elo, and give Master tier something else. I mean look at it, Its platinum for gods sack. The color of the border feels like polished metal or platinum. I don't know. its just how I feel. What do you guys think? Master profile border ( Platinum metal ( P.S I'm not plat elo, so no i'm not crying about 
I prefer to rifle, can awp if asked to. Looking for people that will be open about a team member's age. PM me if you are wondering. Hello reddit, How can it be that the Challenger and the Master tier profile banner is still too short and overleaps the summoner icon. The Challenger banner is now around for over a year and reddit- and forum posts about this issue have been around for the same time. Now the new Master tier banner has the exactly same problem. On the left and right side of the banner, you can still see the old profile borderline and on the left side the banner overleaps the summoner icon what looks really. Hi, I just got the profiles enabled today. I've set them up so there's four profiles, one for each member of my family. However, there's still one profile called 'Wilson', which I'm guessing is the original profile we were all sharing before the profiles got rolled out to us. Is there any way to delete that profile. They are asking for screen shots of master profiles to be entered into a contest. You have to post it on a facebook post. I HIGHLY recommend you do not post that information anywhere. It could be used to steal your account. https://i.imgur.com/3ctiNyk.png EDIT The website says a picture of the app. The email they sent out says to screenshot the master profile. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/318258807203430401/463549688881086475/unknown.png Full image of email entry thing. How do Ryzen Master and the BIOS interact if at all? For example, I have a Ryzen Master profile (1700x) configured with a CPU core voltage of 1.15v and an SOC voltage of 1.1v. When RM says the profile is successfully applied, RM still reads voltages between 1.26v and 1.3v but does report the correct SOC voltage. Additionally, CPU-Z will report the BIOS settings, which is an auto-configured voltage of 1.45v. I also rebooted but same thing. I assume this is why I'm still seeing large
