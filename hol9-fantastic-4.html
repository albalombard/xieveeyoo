                            <p> This is who me and my friend on discord thought should be cast as marvel's first family. Sue Storm - Emily Blunt Reed Richards - John Krasinski Johnny Storm - Ansel Elgort Ben Grimm - John Cena Victor Von Doom - Jason Isaacs OR Orlando Bloom What do you guys think? Who do you wanna see cast as the MCU F4? \ Shoutout to 777 who is amazing with actors. The time-traveling antics of Endgame has gotten the attention of the deep future time-traveling warlord, Kang the Conqueror. Seeing as his name's "The Conqueror," the New Avengers assume that he's come to this time to conquer it. Turns out that in the end, he was actually trying to get into the Quantum Realm to free 5 astronauts that have been trapped there since the late 1960's during a secret space experiment using Pym particles (Kang must do this in order for him to exist in the future I just don’t see any way around it. There’s no way the F4 currently exist in the MCU in secret without the Avengers or SHIELD knowing. And even if they did know of them, how would the F4 not of helped during any of the avengers movies especially during Infinity War when the whole world was at stake?? Skipping a Spider-Man origin story made sense because not only does everyone know his origin story by heart by now, MCU Spider-Man is very young so was kinda under the radar in Queens NY still. Cool. It would be a tragic missed opportunity if phase 4 didn’t culminate with the first Fantastic Four movie as phase 1 got us to the Avengers. The end of phase 3 isn’t like the end of phase 2 with the release of Ant-Man, which was kind of a footnote to that phase. Phase 4 has the double duty of being a gracenote for phase 3, while also prologuing (I might have just made up that word. You can use it if you want though) phase 4. So, after I read and watched lots of “Who is Mysterio” theories 
They announced a couple of months ago that they were going to add the fantastic 4 but haven't heard anything since. Does anyone have any details. Hiya! New to Legendary, just got the base set a few weeks ago, and have the F4 expansion waiting for me after work today. I wanna get some folks together to play it this weekend, but may end up with 5 people, meaning 6 heroes. We want to a run of all the new heroes- the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer (specifically, a 3-gane run where we fight Dr. Doom, Mole Man, and finally Galactus). What do you recommend to play as the 6th hero, aesthetically and/or gameplay wise? Aesthetically I've heard a few people say that one of the things they'd love to see in the MCU would be the fantastic 4 - but we've already had 2 generations of F4 films that were enormous flops. How do you think the MCU could breathe life into the franchise in the same way that Homecoming re-established spiderman? When the russo's were asked what villain they'd wanna see the most, they instantly said Dr. Doom - and i think the fantastic 4 could tie in quite nicely with skrulls. Equally, i reckon that introd. It'll be via a retcon. Since Janet Pym was lost in the quantum realm, Hank would be working to get her back. We know in the 70's, multiple projects were being worked on in the same site; pegasus, goliath & exodus. We know stark (and later mar vel) worked on project pegasus, the tesseract. Hank & bill working on project Goliath. We still don't know what exodus was (rumor to be x-genes) BUT what if it was a scrapped project Reed, Sue & Hank were working on to bring back janet. I wanted to put together some ideas for a Fantastic 4 team before they get their phase 4 introduction. Wasn't sure if they should get the Cosmic or Global territory tag. I saw another post that didn't include numbers get a pretty positive response, so I decided to not include those as well. Let me know what you guys think. Name Alignment Territory Origin Class Team Extra Tag :- :- :- :- :- :- :- Mister Fantastic Hero Global Bio Controller Fantastic 4 1. Basic - Long Punch - Attack prima. They should come from parallel timeline where Galactus destroyed Earth. In endgame when the describe the snap they say it was an energy like the universe had never seen. Imagine that during infinity war the fantastic 4 were decimated but in space then when the return snap happens they are directly above that location in a space station so a very significant portion of that energy is passing through them giving them their powers. This may even allow them to skip the origin story with a line like when we came back we were different. Avengers tower could be donated. Can anyone find a simple to navigate reading order for fantastic 4 I've searched and all I can find are complicated jumps. I've just read Hickmans run and it blew my mind. Makes me want to dive into fantastic. 
Theo is Mr. Fantastic as he is super lanky and Mr. Fantastic has the ability to stretch his limbs. Georgia is The Invisible Woman as she consistently flies under the radar in the house, having a partner who's in an opposite alliance to her. Bear is The Human Torch because he's a hot head who gets under people's skin. Ash is The Thing because he's a fucking giant.
