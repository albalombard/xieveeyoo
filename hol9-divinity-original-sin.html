                            <p> Title. Is it really true? Can you really become a god as the description on the steam page says? Also, are bards a thing? How about duelists with crowd control abilities? I have so many questions. I've never played the original. I like some WRPGs like Skyrim and Witcher, this would be my first isometric adventure. I usually like games for story and fun combat. I know people rave about the game but everytime I watch a bit of gameplay it looks very "meh" NFO (https://predb.pw/x.php?type=nfo&id=dTluNVZXeXNZREpZaDBsSzZHY2cvalFpeEYzNUZZdDh6VjFkL0dRUlR6az0=) NFO (image) (https://i.imgur.com/PULT5i6.png) GOG (https://www.gog.com/game/divinity_original_sin_2) Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/). 
They did so many things right. Combat I usually despise turn based combat, I'm more of an action games person (Nier Automata, Tomb Raider, Titanfall 2, Witcher, ), the only time I managed to get over it was with Wasteland 2, only because I really loved the post apocalyptic setting and the dialogs were also fun, so I went through it anyway. But in DOS2, it feels so right, I never get bored. I had 20+ minutes fights where I would die and I would just take another shot with a different. Basically I have 48 hours in a single (and first) playthrough and didn't even end Act 2 by now, I fucking love all of the interactions specially with the Pet Pal talent and feel like this game is so huge and has some many builds you can chose that I'll have to play it again. 10/10 would recommend. Divinity: Original Sin 2 (https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/divinity-original-sin-ii---definitive-edition) is one of the greatest games ever made, and came out recently, yet there's around 3 unseen posts about this game total. This game needs some love, not to be completely forgotten. If you're looking for a charming, very deep and satisfying RPG, that you can also experience alongside your friends in split-screen or online co-op- or even 100% solo, this game is for you Here's. I noticed they are similarly priced and was wondering how much I will be missing out on having not played the first. So I have actually only had this game for a day and I've so far sunk about 6 hours into it. The initial impression is a very good one and I was loving it in a similar way I was loving Zelda: BOTW when I first started playing that as well. But then the bugs started seeping through, particularly when it comes to quest completion, and sometimes the game starts feeling a little aimless. Both of these things were common critiques with the first game, as well. That said, it's obviously an improved. I recently came across this game on the Xbox store multiple times, and it was on sale for  and I thought " I should try it out. " Now I have played Neverwinter Night's and it was a joy to play, but this game just got me obsessed, I never had this much fun in a CRPG in such a long time, my friends are all playing MK11, which I have as well, but I just can't 
Preface: Yes, I am aware they are two very different games, and yes, I've done a lot of research about both of them, and can't seem to come to a conclusion. Hello r/rpg_gamers! So after years and years of playing online competitive games, I have stepped back a bit and noticed all the games I've missed. I have a little more than  saved up, and have narrowed my selection down to either Divinity: Original Sin II or The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. The last time I was so happily addicted to a rewards system was with The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, and DOS2 gives me quite a few Witcher 3 vibes which is just perfect because that's one of my top 5 games of all time. Digging up chests with your shovel and finding some Rare or Epic pieces is so much fun, and getting massive rewards for beating tough opponents makes it worth while too. Also getting to choose a piece of gear out of 4 options after helping certain NPC's makes it more fun too, because. I've just started Divinity: Original Sin II. I selected Lohse as my avatar, as her story seemed the most interesting to me. However, as I play, I am beginning to wonder if I would like her more as a party member that I can interact with, and it would be easy to restart now and switch over. Roleplaying her could be interesting, but it's not always the best way to see a character's story in these kinds of games. For example, I think to Fall-from-Grace in Planescape: Torment. It would Howdy folks Myself and a buddy recently started a series called "Cream of the Cro Op", where we play all of the best rated Cooperative PC games. Divinity Original Sin 2 has come across the radar!
