Hey guys, I'm posting this because I need to know if I'm the only one who has this. Recently I noticed that the hair in my game changed. It used to have some sort of shine and looked overall better, however a few patches later I look at it and it looks completely different then how it used to, consistent with all heroes with the worst offenders being Tracer and Sombra. Here are in game before and afters, how the hair supposed to look like and how it looks like in-game for me. Sombra - Before.

___ What is this? ___ The idea behind the monthly community map is to share a map exchange string at the beginning of every month, and get as many people as we can to start a new world with it. Then at the end of the month (or even periodically if you'd prefer!) we share screenshots and saves of our factories so that we can see how different people approach the same spawn; how they set up their base, how they deal with aliens, and how they arrange their science, power, and everything else. Yes, I know I'm 2 months late but I was kind of in denial over the fact I've done this :) amp#x200B; This is my 2nd spark, my first one being the Summer Kirari/Syuko (https://www.reddit.com/r/StarlightStage/comments/9b7oqs/300_pulls_for_summer_kirarisyuko_90_free_gem_spark/) which was mostly free gems and planned from the beginning of 2018!

I used the gif from the original concept art that Gem Lim (https://www.artstation.com/artwork/JGg9n) made. She's interactable, meaning that each time you click on her she will say something (six random quotes in total). Also, you can change her orientation to be flipped via right mouse click on the image → variants. Screenshot (https://imgur.com/a/rm99bH6) Download. So I've got a problem, seemingly power-related, with my 2080ti. It's almost as if power delivery to the card is being artificially limited somehow. So with Metro Exodus being the first "GPU melting" game since I built my PC, I was pretty excited to try it. This game was my first clue that things aren't what they should be. Only a clue, though - other benchmarks aren't where they should be, and In UserBenchmark, I'm " Performing way below expectations (13th percentile) (https://i.imgur.com/4zBlV.

I finished Sunshine See May with 583,366 points, ending at rank 108. (https://i.imgur.com/OFoYcfN.png) This was by far the craziest thing I've done in any game, and even though I fell short of my initial goal of top 100 I'm still very happy with the outcome. This event also taught me a few things in regards to high end tiering, which I may or may not apply at a later date to redeem myself.but I'll get to that later. -------------------- # Pre-Event Planning As soon as I caught NONSTARTERS Starting to get seriously into JPN and as much as I love Pasupare I feel like it's TOO MUCH, and not enough of my fav band. :'( Here it is! (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dx-PIJQU8AEmnrm.jpg) It's still very farmable! Most if not all of the 2 cards still have stories to unlock, and there's still some 1 cards with stories. I mostly used it to practice songs with and reckless gacha. If you'd like more screenshots let me know! I don't mind if your account is a starter NONSTARTERS Hey friends! I tried scouting for the new hina/sayo pair except they didn't come home Here are the screenshots (https://imgur.com/a/QipNsYH) for the account: it's rank 51 with 1775 (free) stars. Has both christmas ran and moca as well as (carnival?/holiday) tae and blue rose yukina. The account itself is more afterglow based, and not too many songs have been fc'd (pretty much only roselia songs + a few covers here and there; haven't really touched songs from other bands) Ideal. As revealed in today's MiriRaji, the next gacha update (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411083210659725324/499919498917445642/Screenshot_20181011-202124.jpg) (which will come tomorrow at 3PM JST) features the following cards (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/411083210659725324/499919613140795392/Screenshot_20181011-202146.jpg): - LIM Makoto SSR. - PERM Hinata SSR, Shizuka SR ( Elena R (http://mill.tokyo/card/noframe20/noframe198. It took me a while to make a post for this because I was busy last week. I didn't screenshot when I was doing gacha except for the last two, so I have to screenshot them in my present box instead. My inventory had space so it had 30 of them (I arranged my list in time order so you can see there're 30 lv1 idols and every 10 of them is an SR). The remaining 270 of them were in the present box. A lot of images. Be careful if you're using mobile data. Guess how many SSRs did I get in 300 pulls. --- #Introduction The song spotlight is a recurring topic on this subreddit, where every week we will feature a different song included in the game or its DLC and discuss things like how to play its different riffs, techniques to focus on and more casual things like some interesting trivia or the artist's other work. Finally we'll conclude with a score attack challenge, a random entrant of which will be offered to choose the next song. The format will change depending on feedback and particip. NONSTARTERS Almost all 4 scorers are skill lv 5 except for Eve who is skill lv 3 I got some new 3 s along with Lim Rinko I have some Top 100 song titles Screenshots (https://imgur.com/mfgy0Mm) LF:Aya, Chisato 
Warning ,spoilers! If you don't want to know spoilers about season 2 of produce, just read first part about produce 48. When WUSPLE become hot topic, quite a lot of people claimed that it’s nothing new in produce and it’s always like that Mnet have favourites,etc . But I am quite hardcore fan of produce and last season I was part of Wink fanbase which was very sensitive to any manipulation of Mnet and I had different impression of it. But the impression is only impression MULTIPLE Hello! Making another post since it's been a while. Still looking for Lim. Bday Kotori/ Maki on the JP server but otherwise feel free to offer anything!
